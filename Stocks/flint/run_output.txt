  warnings.warn(
Could not generate Monte-Carlo signal: A KerasTensor cannot be used as input to a TensorFlow function. A KerasTensor is a symbolic placeholder for a shape and dtype, used when constructing Keras Functional models or Keras Functions. You can only use it as input to a Keras layer or a Keras operation (from the namespaces `keras.layers` and `keras.ops`). You are likely doing something like:

```
x = Input(...)
...
tf_fn(x)  # Invalid.
```

What you should do instead is wrap `tf_fn` in a layer:

```
class MyLayer(Layer):
    def call(self, x):
        return tf_fn(x)

x = MyLayer()(x)
```
