## Summary of Improvements

* **Persistent Studies per Ticker**: Added `load_if_exists=True` to `optuna.create_study()`, so running the script with the same ticker name reuses its existing study instead of creating a fresh one each time .
* **Dynamic Study Logging**: Logs whether a study was newly created or loaded with previous trials, including the total number of existing trials.
* **Centralized SQLite Storage**([optuna.readthedocs.io][1], [optuna.readthedocs.io][2])
`tuning.db` file to store all Optuna studies, keyed by`study\_name\`, ensuring no manual deletion of DB files is needed between runs.

## Database Usage & Sample Queries

The SQLite database at `results/tuning.db` contains an Optuna schema with tables such as `studies`, `trials`, `trial_params`, and `trial_metrics`. You can inspect and query your tuning progress directly.

### Expected Workflow

1. **Run**

   ```bash
   uv run tune.py AAPL --trials 50
   ```

   * Creates (or loads) the study `xgb_tuning_AAPL`, adds up to 50 new trials, and persists them in `results/tuning.db`.
2. **Re-run**

   ```bash
   uv run tune.py AAPL --trials 30
   ```

   * Loads the existing `xgb_tuning_AAPL` study and runs 30 more trials, appending results.

### Sample Queries

#### 1. List all studies

```sql
SELECT study_name, direction
FROM studies;
```

* **Purpose**: Show each study’s name and optimization direction ([TutorialsPoint][3]).

#### 2. Get total trials per study

```sql
SELECT s.study_name, COUNT(t.trial_id) AS num_trials
FROM studies s
JOIN trials t ON s.study_id = t.study_id
GROUP BY s.study_name;
```

* **Purpose**: See how many trials exist for each ticker study ([SQLite Tutorial][4]).

#### 3. Fetch best parameters for a study

```sql
SELECT param_name, param_value
FROM trial_params
WHERE trial_id = (
    SELECT t.trial_id
    FROM trials t
    WHERE t.study_id = (
        SELECT study_id FROM studies WHERE study_name = 'xgb_tuning_AMZN'
    )
    AND t.value = (
        SELECT MIN(value) FROM trials WHERE study_id = t.study_id
    )
);
```

* **Purpose**: Retrieve the hyperparameters of the trial with the lowest objective (logloss) for `AMZN` ([GeeksforGeeks][5]).

#### 4. Show all tables and columns

```sql
SELECT 
    m.name AS table_name,
    p.name AS column_name,
    p.type AS data_type,
    p.pk AS is_primary_key
FROM sqlite_master AS m
JOIN pragma_table_info(m.name) AS p
WHERE m.type = 'table'
ORDER BY table_name, p.cid;
```

* **Purpose**: Analyze how logloss evolved over boosting rounds for each trial ([Prisma][6]).

## Next Steps & Enhancements

Based on earlier requests, you can incrementally layer in features:

1. **ASHA Pruner Option**:

   * Add `--pruner asha` to switch to `SuccessiveHalvingPruner(min_resource=1, reduction_factor=2)` for alternative pruning strategies ([SQLite Tutorial][7]).

2. **Nested CV Tuning**:

   * Use a `StratifiedKFold` loop, compute average logloss across folds, and call `trial.report()` at the end of each trial rather than inside callbacks to avoid signature pitfalls.

3. **Multi-Objective Mode**:

   * Expand to `directions=['minimize','minimize']`, return `(loss, elapsed_time)` from the objective, and visualize the Pareto front via Plotly or Optuna’s built-in dashboard.

4. **Rich Experiment Tracking**:

   * Leverage `optuna-dashboard sqlite:///results/tuning.db` for real-time monitoring and integrate trial attributes (e.g., GPU usage) into the `trial_params` table for deeper post-hoc analysis ([neptune.ai][8]).

This stepwise approach lets you maintain working code at each stage while progressively reintroducing advanced features.

3. Averaging Best Params Across 10 Tickers

    You could take the mean (or median) of each numeric hyperparameter from 10 per-ticker best_params files to produce a “generic” config.

    Caveats:

        Hyperparameters interact non-linearly; the average of good settings isn’t guaranteed to work well for any one ticker.

        Better approach: ensemble models trained with each ticker’s best params or cluster tickers by behavior and tune one representative per cluster.

{
  "n_estimators": 1200,            // Number of boosting rounds (trees) to train.
  "learning_rate": 0.2854,         // Shrinkage factor applied to each tree’s contribution.
  "max_depth": 5,                  // Maximum depth of each tree (controls model complexity).
  "subsample": 0.8835,             // Fraction of training rows sampled per round (prevents overfitting).
  "colsample_bytree": 0.8041,      // Fraction of features sampled per tree (adds randomness).
  "gamma": 0.0008587,              // Minimum loss reduction required to make a split (regularization).
  "min_child_weight": 5            // Minimum sum of hessian (instance weight) needed in a leaf node.
}

## Summary

Your revised `tune.py` cleanly separates XGBoost and your custom PyTorch transformer tuning, unifies persistence into a single JSON file per ticker, and leverages Optuna’s multivariate TPE sampler with Hyperband pruning in both cases. Overall it’s well-structured and consistent. Below are detailed observations on each section, plus targeted suggestions to harden your transformer tuning loop, improve reproducibility, and eke out a bit more performance and maintainability.

---

## 1. XGBoost Section

### What’s Working Well

* **Clean separation** of directories and storage paths via `_ensure_dirs()` and `STORAGE_URL`.
* **Multivariate TPE + Hyperband** pruner is a strong pairing for pruning unpromising parameter sets quickly.
* **EarlyStopping callback** guarantees `best_score` is always defined, avoiding previous pitfalls.
* **Minimalist API**: the `objective` returns `model.best_score` directly, keeping the loop succinct.

### Suggestions

1. **Seed Control**

   ```python
   np.random.seed(42)
   ```

   before the trial loop (or inside `objective`) to ensure reproducible sampling of stochastic XGBoost behaviors .

2. **Batch Logging**
   Add a debug log inside `objective` showing the trial’s key hyperparameters and its final `best_score` to aid post-hoc analysis:

   ```python
   logging.debug(f"Trial {trial.number} params: {params} → logloss {val:.4f}")
   ```

3. **Parallel Trials**
   If your infrastructure allows, consider `n_jobs` or an `RDBStorage`-backed study with `n_jobs>1` in `study.optimize(...)` for concurrent trials.

---

## 2. Custom Transformer Section

### What’s Working Well

* **Unified data sourcing** via `prepare_and_cache_data` keeps the XGBoost and transformer pipelines aligned.
* **StandardScaler + sequence creation** outside the Optuna loop avoids redundant preprocessing per trial.
* **Per-trial DataLoader instantiation** within `objective` correctly adapts to the sampled `batch_size`.
* **Explicit epoch loop with `trial.report`** and `trial.should_prune()` gives fine-grained pruning control.

### Suggestions

1. **Deterministic Seeding**
   At the top of `objective`, set seeds for NumPy and PyTorch:

   ```python
   seed = 42 + trial.number
   np.random.seed(seed)
   torch.manual_seed(seed)
   if torch.cuda.is_available():
       torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
   ```

   This ensures each trial is repeatable and isolates random initialization .

2. **Pin Memory & Workers**
   Speed up DataLoader on GPU hosts:

   ```python
   train_loader = DataLoader(
       train_ds, batch_size=..., shuffle=True,
       pin_memory=True, num_workers=4
   )
   ```

3. **Gradient Clipping**
   Prevent occasional exploding gradients in deep transformers:

   ```python
   torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
   ```

4. **Learning‐Rate Scheduler**
   Incorporate a simple scheduler (e.g., `StepLR` or `CosineAnnealingLR`) and include its hyperparameters in the search space for smoother convergence:

   ```python
   scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=5, gamma=0.5)
   ```

5. **Early‐Stopping Patience**
   Rather than always run `max_epochs`, you can prune within training if no improvement for `patience` epochs:

   ```python
   best_epoch = epoch if avg_val_loss < best_val_loss else best_epoch
   if epoch - best_epoch >= patience:
       break  # stop training early
   ```

6. **Time Tracking (Optional Multi-Objective)**
   If you want to revisit multi-objective tuning later, record elapsed seconds per trial:

   ```python
   start_t = time.perf_counter()
   # after training loop
   duration = time.perf_counter() - start_t
   trial.set_user_attr("duration", duration)
   ```

7. **Model Checkpointing (Optional)**
   Save the best transformer weights per trial to disk with `torch.save(model.state_dict(), path)` so you can later load top models for ensembling.

---

## 3. General Code Hygiene

* **Consistent Imports**: Remove unused imports (`yaml`, `os` if unused) to keep dependencies minimal.
* **Error Handling**: Wrap your `study.optimize` in a `try/except KeyboardInterrupt` to allow graceful shutdown and partial results saving.
* **Documentation**: Add docstrings to each function summarizing expected inputs (e.g. shape of `prepare_sequences` outputs) and outputs (the JSON structure).

---

## Conclusion

Your updated script strikes a solid balance between flexibility and maintainability, giving you robust tuning for both XGBoost and your custom PyTorch transformer. By adding deterministic seeding, DataLoader optimizations, optional scheduling/clipping, and minimal logging enhancements, you’ll make experiments fully reproducible and even more efficient. Let me know if you’d like code snippets for any of these suggestions!
