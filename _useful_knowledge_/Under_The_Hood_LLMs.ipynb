    "### A Clarification on the Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a crucial point of clarification. The model you are using in Google AI Studio with the 1 million token context window is **Gemini 1.5 Pro**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today, a model named \"Gemini 2.5 Pro\" has not been publicly released. This is fantastic news, because it means all the advanced capabilities and the massive context window are available to you right now, and this guide will apply directly to the powerful tool you are already using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's address your core question about the token limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should You Reset Your Chat at 100,000 Tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emphatically no.** Your current habit of stopping chats and summarizing them for a new instance is a holdover from working with older, context-limited models. With Gemini 1.5 Pro, this practice is actively counterproductive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **You Are Discarding Memory:** The 1M token context window is the model's active, high-fidelity memory. A summary is a lossy, compressed version of that memory. By starting a new chat, you are forcing the model to work with a degraded understanding of your project's history and nuances.\n",
    "*   **You Are Wasting Its Primary Strength:** The ability to hold an entire codebase or a long, complex conversation in memory is the single biggest advantage of Gemini 1.5 Pro. Resetting the chat is like buying a supercomputer and only using it as a calculator.\n",
    "*   **There Is No Cost:** In the free tier of Google AI Studio, you are not \"spending\" tokens from a limited pool. The 1,048,576 token limit is the size of the memory buffer for your chat. You are encouraged to use as much of it as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Correct Approach:** Keep your chat going. Let the token count grow. The model is designed to handle it. If you need to re-focus the conversation, use your summarization skill *within the same chat* to guide the model, not to reset it.\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Complete Guide to AI Studio Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "This panel controls the model's behavior, from its creativity and precision to its ability to interact with the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Settings (The \"Creativity & Personality\" Knobs)\n",
    "\n",
    "These settings dictate the randomness and style of the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Temperature** (Range: 0.0 to 2.0)\n",
    "*   **What it is:** The master control for creativity vs. coherence.\n",
    "*   **`0.0 - 0.4` (Low):** Highly deterministic and focused. The model will choose the most logical and probable next word. It's precise, factual, and safe.\n",
    "*   **`0.5 - 1.0` (Medium):** A balance between creativity and predictability. Good for brainstorming, writing drafts, or providing explanations.\n",
    "*   **`1.1 - 2.0` (High/Experimental):** Extremely creative, random, and potentially chaotic. The model will frequently choose less likely words, leading to highly novel and unexpected outputs. This can be powerful for breaking creative blocks but may produce nonsensical text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Top-P** (Range: 0.0 to 1.0)\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Creates a pool of the most likely next words based on their cumulative probability. A value of `0.95` means the model considers words from the most likely until the sum of their probabilities reaches 95%.\n",
    "*   **Low Top-P (`≤ 0.8`):** Creates a \"safer,\" more predictable output by cutting off the long tail of less likely words.\n",
    "*   **High Top-P (`≥ 0.95`):** Allows for more diversity and surprise by keeping a wider range of potential words in play.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Top-K** (Range: 1 to 40)\n",
    "*   **What it is:** A blunter instrument than Top-P. It forces the model to choose only from the `K` most probable next words.\n",
    "*   **Interaction with Top-P:** If you use both, the model will choose from the intersection of the two pools. A low Top-K (e.g., 5) can severely restrict the model, even if Top-P is high. **It's generally recommended to adjust Top-P and leave Top-K at its maximum (40) unless you have a specific need to limit the vocabulary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Settings (The \"Shape & Format\" Knobs)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output length**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** A hard limit on the number of tokens the model can generate in a single response.\n",
    "*   **When to use it:** Useful when you need a concise answer or are generating content for a space-limited format. It can prevent overly verbose responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Add stop sequence**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Forces the model to stop generating text immediately if it produces a specific string of characters.\n",
    "*   **When to use it:** Invaluable for generating structured data. If you ask for a list of three items, setting the stop sequence to \"4.\" ensures it doesn't generate more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools (The \"Action & Grounding\" Knobs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Gemini 1.5 Pro becomes more than just a text generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Grounding with Google Search**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Allows the model to perform Google searches in real-time to verify its information and find up-to-date facts. You will see \"Searching...\" indicators when it's active.\n",
    "*   **When to use it:** **Turn ON** for any task requiring factual accuracy, research, current events, or summarizing information about real-world entities. It dramatically reduces hallucinations.\n",
    "*   **When to turn it OFF:** Purely creative tasks (writing a fictional story) or when analyzing a self-contained context (like your uploaded code) where external information is irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code execution**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Gives the model a built-in Python interpreter. It can write and run code to perform calculations, test its own logic, or analyze data.\n",
    "*   **When to use it:** **Turn ON** for almost any coding, debugging, or data analysis task. It allows the model to verify its solutions and perform complex numerical reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function calling & Structured output**\n",
    "*   **What they are:** Advanced tools for developers. They force the model's output into a specific, machine-readable format like JSON.\n",
    "*   **When to use them:** When you are building an application that needs to programmatically parse the model's response (e.g., feeding the output into another tool or API). For general chat use, these are not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Settings (The \"Behavior & Guardrails\" Knobs)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Thinking**\n",
    "*   **Thinking mode:**\n",
    "    *   **Standard:** The default. Fast and optimized for a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "    *   **Extended:** Slower, more thorough. The model takes more time to process, often resulting in higher-quality, more coherent answers for very complex prompts.\n",
    "*   **Set thinking budget:** A time limit (in seconds) for the \"Extended\" thinking mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Media Resolution**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Controls how much detail the model extracts from uploaded images or videos.\n",
    "*   **Standard:** Fast, low-cost. Good for general image understanding.\n",
    "*   **High:** Slower, more detailed. Use this when you need the model to perform OCR (read text from an image) or analyze fine details in a complex diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Safety settings**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** The content moderation filter. The default (\"Block some\") is appropriate for almost all use cases.\n",

    "### Recommended Settings for Different Tasks (Revised & Expanded)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task Persona | Temperature | Top-P | Top-K | Grounding | Code Execution | Thinking | Rationale |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **The Precise Coder** | **0.1** | 0.95 | 40 | Off | **On** | Standard | **Goal: Correctness.** Low temperature ensures deterministic, logical code. High Top-K/P provides a full vocabulary of correct syntax. Code Execution is critical for self-verification. |\n",
    "| **The Repo Auditor** | **0.2** | 0.98 | 40 | Off | **On** | **Extended** | **Goal: Deep Logic Tracing.** Slightly higher temp allows for more nuanced explanations. Extended thinking helps it trace complex inter-dependencies across your entire codebase. Code Execution lets it test snippets. |\n",
    "| **The Factual Researcher** | **0.0** | 0.9 | 30 | **On** | On | Standard | **Goal: Verifiable Accuracy.** Temperature at zero minimizes speculation. Grounding is non-negotiable to fact-check against Google Search. A slightly lower Top-K/P reinforces focus. |\n",
    "| **The Creative Storyteller** | **1.2** | 1.0 | 40 | **Off** | Off | Standard | **Goal: Novelty & Surprise.** High temperature encourages a wide, diverse, and unexpected vocabulary. Turning Grounding off is essential to prevent the model from being constrained by reality. |\n",
    "| **The Divergent Brainstormer** | **1.8** | 1.0 | 40 | Off | Off | Standard | **Goal: Maximum Chaos & Connection.** Pushing temperature to its limit forces the model to make wild, non-obvious connections between ideas. This is for breaking creative blocks, not for generating coherent prose. |\n",
    "| **The API Integrator** | **0.5** | 0.95 | 40 | On/Off | On | Standard | **Goal: Structured Output.** Temperature is medium to ensure the content is coherent. The key here is using the **Structured Output** or **Function Calling** tools to force the response into a perfect JSON schema. |"
